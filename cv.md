### About me
I worked for seven years in the electronics industry, for the last two years I have been writing control programs for automatic assembly lines. While studying at the university, I became interested in website development, it became my hobby. Before developing websites, I studied marketing, design and functionality of website builders. After learning the basics, I started developing small websites using a website builder. Today, I want to participate and implement more complex and interesting projects, for which the site design functions are not enough. I want to turn my hobby into a job. That is why I study HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
